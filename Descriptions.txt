Some descriptions can go here:

1. To set-up install the OpenCV from source forge
2. Next, follow the link http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10901905/installing-opencv-2-4-3-in-visual-c-2010-express
to set up a project in VStudio the dll way.

!!! VC11 is for VS2012

Remove the opencv_haartraining_engined.lib while adding Linker - input -additional dependencies
and there are some *.lib files missing in the link.. cross check them
all *.lib files reside in opencv\build\x86\vc12\staticlib

3. Make the project solution platform x64 from win32 (next to debugger)

OpenGL is already in system. But need to download GLFW and GLEW.
Adding GLFW is easy. But adding GLEW is a pain (trick: move the glew32.lib from lib/release/x64 
to under lib/)
